# Introduction

You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

This project serves as a practical exercise in system administration: A secure virtual machine is configured, involving user authentication, firewall rules, and system monitoring, with a focus on Linux system administration and network security.

## Features

- **Operating System Configuration:** Set up a Debian server with minimal services and create partitions using LVM.
- **User and Group Management:** Manage users and groups through sudoers configuration for controlled access and privileges.
- **Security Measures:** Implement robust security protocols, covering SSH configuration, root access restriction, UFW setup, and enforcing a stringent password policy.
- **System Monitoring Script:** Develop a monitoring.sh bash script to provide regular system information updates on all terminals at predefined intervals.
- **WordPress Website Setup:** Host a WordPress website using lighttpd, MariaDB, and PHP.
